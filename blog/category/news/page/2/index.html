<p><strong>My co-founder, Aaron Parecki, and I share a belief: Things happen in places. We all carry around incredibly powerful mobile phones in our pockets, and we spend all our time interacting with them and not with the world around us. We believe that location services should be an invisible trigger for actions that take place on the device or in the cloud.</strong></p>
<p>Aaron and I set out to start a company that would help developers create calm applications that recede into the background and only present themselves to users when they have contextually relevant actions or information to share. Our hope is to get people to look up from their screens and go about their daily lives.</p>
<p>The reality is that building a location service within an application is <strong>complex</strong> and <strong>time-consuming</strong>.</p>
<h3>The Old School Way</h3>
<p>You have to figure out how the different mobile platforms handle location features, how you’ll enable push-messaging in these different environments, how to set up a system for storing the geodata, how to create a method for tracking and analyzing the data, and, most importantly, how to make your location app accurate without draining the phone’s battery.</p>
<p>We founded Geoloqi to hide all the complexity of developing a location service “under the hood”. Geoloqi has published a robust, next-generation, location-based platform that makes it easy for developers to add location context within their mobile apps.</p>
<h3>Geoloqi to the Rescue!</h3>
<p>One of the primary problems with location-tracking apps today is that they have a tendency to drain smartphones’ batteries by always running the GPS in the background, or constantly pinging cell towers. <img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1904" title="titanium-geoloqi-location-module" src="https://geoloqi.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/titanium-geoloqi-location-module.png" alt="Titanium Geoloqi Module" width="350" height="302" /> Geoloqi uses algorithms that know when to turn the GPS on and off, which preserves battery life. For example, if your app is using a geofence, it knows that the GPS doesn’t have to constantly be running unless the user is near that geofence.</p>
<p>Another problem has been enabling individualized geotriggers. Unlike first-generation location services that use geofences as filters to determine which group of users to send a broadcast message to, our advanced platform allows your application to push messages and execute events to a single end-user at the moment they cross into a geofence, dwell within it, or depart the zone.</p>
<h3>Use Cases</h3>
<p><a href="https://geoloqi.com/blog/2012/05/unleashing-the-next-generation-of-location-with-geoloqis-titanium-module/geoloqi-visual-trigger-editor-3/" rel="attachment wp-att-1926"><img src="https://geoloqi.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/geoloqi-visual-trigger-editor-604x413.png" alt="Geoloqi Visual Trigger Editor" title="geoloqi-visual-trigger-editor" width="604" height="413" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1926" /></a><br />
The opportunities these geo-triggered events enables are limitless:</p>
<h4>Retail</h4>
<p>Imagine a large retail chain that is able to push their (opted in) loyal customers a message as they enter the store, not only welcoming them to the store by name and providing them with loyalty points for their visit, but also integrated into the chain’s CRM system to allow the app to mention that their favorite item is on sale that day.</p>
<h4>Hospitality</h4>
<p>Imagine a hotel chain that automatically recognizes that a patron has pulled into their parking lot, automatically checks the user into the hotel, and has their room key and paperwork waiting at the front desk by the time they walk in from the lot.</p>
<h4>Deals and Rewards</h4>
<p>Alert users to nearby deals by sending them a push notifications when they are within a few blocks of an offer! Use an existing database of offers or use the Geoloqi visual trigger editor to create custom ones. Or, use Geoloqi to give virtual currency for their favorite mobile game if they visit the a venue or store.</p>
<h4>Tourism</h4>
<p>Tourism boards can create location-based tours of historical information that will send messages to users about points of interest as they travel around a city or state.</p>
<h4>Home Automation</h4>
<p>Trigger a home automation system to turn the lights on when a person gets home, and automatically turn off when one leaves.</p>
<h3>The Geoloqi Titanium Module</h3>
<p>The Geoloqi Titanium module enables persistent/ambient background location tracking, intelligent battery management, and transitions smoothly between location sources such as carrier signals, GPS and Wifi for true real-time tracking. It also provides rich location and dwell-time analytics, giving your clients the ability to analyze and take action on location data.</p>
<p>At Geoloqi, we are excited to give you the tools to easily make location services that are present when your user needs them and invisible when they don&#8217;t.</p>

<strong>Today we launched the <a href="http://loqi.me/titanium">Geoloqi module for the Titanium platform</a>, an easy way to add location to Titanium applications. This is a great step forward for location services.</strong> For the first time, Appcelerator&#8217;s 1.6 million developers have access to advanced geolocation tools and services right from their home base. Below is a sample of the press coverage we received today. </p>
<h3><a href="http://venturebeat.com/2012/05/22/geoloqi-appcelerator/">Venturebeat: Better location tools for more apps: Geoloqi is now on Appcelerator Titanium</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The two companies have been cozied up for a few months already. Now, they’re giving devs a two-month trial to test drive Geoloqi on Appcelerator’s Titanium 2.0 platform. In a word, this means better location tools will be available for more kinds of apps, and they’ll be easier to use for a wider range of developers.&#8221; &#8211; Jolie O&#8217;Dell</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://gigaom.com/2012/05/22/geoloqis-location-tracking-now-available-to-appcelerator-devs/">GigaOM: Geoloqi&#8217;s location tracking now available to Appcelerator devs</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The partnership has the potential to kickstart a lot more location-aware apps. Appcelerator has 1.6 million iOS and Android developers, who use Titanium to create apps. Now, they can drop in Appcelerator’s tool kit into their apps to enable geo-triggered events.&#8221; &#8211; Ryan Kim</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2012/05/22/geoloqi-adds-powerful-location-module-to-appcelerator/">ProgrammableWeb: Geoloqi Adds Powerful Location Module to Appcelerator</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Writing a location based mobile application is not easy. Often people think it is about getting a latitude / longitude and providing some context aware data/action based on the retrieved location. One of the frequent complaints from users of location based applications is their high battery consumption and also lack of accurate contextual data. With Geoloqi taking care of this in their module, developers can hope to focus on their application functionality.&#8221; &#8211; Romin Irani</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/22/appcelerator-partners-with-geoloqi-to-bring-location-services-to-its-1-6-million-developers/">TechCrunch: Appcelerator Partners With Geoloqi To Bring Location Services To Its 1.6 Million Developers</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Thanks to the new Geoloqi module, developers can now create geo-triggered events in their applications. This, says Appcelerator, will allow its developers to create apps that make use of geofencing and can, for example, send users a push notification when they cross the border into or out of a geofenced zone.&#8221; &#8211; Frederic Lardinois </p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/geoloqi-partners-with-appcelerator/">DigitalTrends: Geoloqi and Appcelerator join forces for location app development – minus the battery suck</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;If you take one look at the state of location apps, you should see that there’s a distinct need for something like this. The last year is littered with the remains of location apps that didn’t work, drained battery, pushed too many notifications, or too few. “While it’s not impossible to get good accuracy and battery life, it’s like doing your taxes – nobody wants to do their taxes,” says Case. Founders and developers (often one in the same) get caught up promoting and designing an app, sometimes failing to do the dirty work — and Geoloqi is more than happy to lay a foundation for them.&#8221; &#8211; Molly McHugh</p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://devopsangle.com/2012/05/22/geoloqi-api-and-dev-kit-launching-on-titanium/">SiliconAngle: Geoloqi API and Dev Kit Launching on Titanium</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Geoloqi is an embedded solution that lays down the ground work for just about any location-based service, whether it’s a Foursquare clone or an enterprise app.  And today the platform reached a very significant milestone – it’s now an add-on in Titanium 2.0.&#8221; &#8211; Maria Deutscher </p></blockquote>
<h3><a href="http://www.geoplace.com/ME2/dirmod.asp?sid=&#038;nm=&#038;type=MultiPublishing&#038;mod=PublishingTitles&#038;mid=13B2F0D0AFA04476A2ACC02ED28A405F&#038;tier=4&#038;id=5310EEFB2B464F159FC8F78E477E2B42">GeoPlace: Geoloqi Now Available on Appcelerator Titanium with a Two-month Free Trial</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;&#8221;Appcelerator customers have been asking for a true, dependable geolocation solution and location-based analytics platform, and we found one in Geoloqi,&#8221; said Jeff Haynie, CEO of Appcelerator. “It’s the first geolocation platform that enables individualized geo-triggered events within an application.

<h3>Press Release</h3>
<p>PORTLAND, OR &#8211; May 22, 2012 &#8211;  Geoloqi, a powerful platform for next-generation location-based services, today announced the availability of the Geoloqi module for Appcelerator’s Titanium 2.0 platform. Geoloqi’s API and complete toolkit enable persistent location awareness with very minimal impact to battery consumption, so applications can truly behave in a context-aware manner. Its robust geolocation capabilities are now available to Appcelerator’s global network of over 1.6 million Titanium iOS and Android developers.</p>
<p>Additionally, Geoloqi has made customizable geo-triggered events possible for the first time ever, which allow push messages and events to be directed to a single end-user at the moment that they cross into a geofence (a location zone that triggers a push notification or other action), dwell within it or depart the zone for a host of next-generation uses. Geoloqi also enables persistent/ambient background location tracking, and transitions smoothly between location sources such as carrier signals, GPS, Wifi and indoor tracking systems.  The platform also provides rich location and dwell-time analytics, giving customers the ability to analyze location data for the first time. Its advanced security settings with easy opt-in and opt-out features ensure safety and privacy practices are automatically updated at any time.<br />

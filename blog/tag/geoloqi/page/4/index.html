        <p><img src="https://geoloqi.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/geoloqi-pinball-layer-geolocation.jpg" alt="Geoloqi Pinball Layer Geolocation" title="geoloqi-pinball-layer-geolocation" width="640" height="226" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1667" /></p>
<p><strong>Geoloqi has a new layer that is going to make your coin jars a lot more empty.</strong></p>
<p>When we&#8217;re not working (which we love to do), we also love to play pinball. It turns out (we only recently found this out) that the city we live and work in is one of the <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=7375966n">top pinball cities in America</a>). There&#8217;s a great website called the <a href="http://pinballmap.com">Pinball Map</a> that (using crowdsourcing) keeps track of the pinball machines in cities all over the country. They also have a a great iPhone and Android app so you can update and find machines (Scott Wainstock and Ryan Gratzer worked on the apps and the Pinball Map site, and did a great job with them).</p>
<p><a href="https://geoloqi.com/blog/2012/04/geoloqi-now-detects-nearby-pinball-machines/geoloqi-pinball-geo-notification-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-1651"><img src="https://geoloqi.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/geoloqi-pinball-geo-notification1-200x300.png" alt="Geoloqi Pinball Geo Notification" title="geoloqi-pinball-geo-notification" width="200" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1651" /></a></p>
<p>We wanted to see if we could use Geoloqi to automatically let us know when we were near a bar with pinball machines. So we combined the Pinball Map data with Geoloqi, and the result is the Geoloqi Pinball Machine Detector!</p>
<p>How it works: When you walk by a venue that has a pinball machine, Geoloqi automatically detects it and sends you a message, which has the name of the venue, and the names of all the pinball machines. We tried it out recently, and it was great. We first found a bar with CSI and the new Batman pinball machine, both of which were only a week old (the Pinball Map data is remarkably up-to-date).</p>
<p>Next we walked by the Shanghai Tunnel, a bar in downtown Portland, which had five machines in the basement. The machines weren&#8217;t visible from the road, so I would have never known about them without the Pinball layer. I&#8217;ve found a lot of great new places to stop in and visit since I started using it. It&#8217;s surprising how many hidden gems you can find, even in the neighborhood you live in.</p>
<p>We also found a really odd Elton John pinball machine (<a href="http://www.ipdb.org/machine.cgi?gid=438">Captain Fantastic</a>) in the shoe store across from Powell&#8217;s (a big bookstore in downtown Portland). We&#8217;ve walked by it hundreds of times, and still had no idea it was there.</p>
<p><img src="https://geoloqi.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/pinball-map-site-300x119.jpg" alt="Pinball Map Site" title="pinball-map-site" width="300" height="119" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1656" /></p>
<p>The layer only took a few hours to build, and it was very easy to implement. It&#8217;s my favorite layer for Geoloqi right now (the Dinosaur Fossils layer is a close second). I was able to use our visual Layer Editor to track and view progress while the script was importing. It&#8217;s a lot of data, but our front-end designer/developer (Patrick Arlt) was able to use our Javascript SDK to make direct calls to the API from our editor, which improves performance a lot, so even with a lot of data, the layer editor works great. It makes a big difference to be able to see the data you&#8217;re working with!</p>
<p><a href="https://geoloqi.com/blog/2012/04/geoloqi-now-detects-nearby-pinball-machines/geoloqi-pinball-map-layer/" rel="attachment wp-att-1636"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1636" title="geoloqi-pinball-map-layer" src="https://geoloqi.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/geoloqi-pinball-map-layer-604x339.png" alt="Geoloqi Pinball Map Layer" width="604" height="339" /></a></p>
<p>Anything with geo-location can be made into a layer like this. We&#8217;ve been having a lot of fun implementing these, and we&#8217;re always looking for more ideas and datasets to import in the future. If you have any ideas in mind, you should send them to us (or better yet, make your own layer!).</p>

<h3>Where does it work?</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re in any of the following cities, you can use this layer to get Pinball notifications!<br />
<strong>Austin, San Francisco, Boston, British Columbia, Chicago, Colorado, Dallas, Jacksonville, Los Angeles, New York City, Pittsburgh, Portland, Sacramento, San Diego, Seattle, Spokane</strong></p>
<h3>Try it Out!</h3>
<p>Download the Geoloqi app and subscribe to the Pinball layer! It&#8217;s free.. unlike the pinball machines.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mobile developers want the best of both worlds from location companies: the whiz-bang tools from device-based location and the massive footprint and no battery-drain from network location.  Together, Locaid and Geoloqi give developers a one-two punch, the first such partnership in the history of location-based services,&#8221; said Rip Gerber, Locaid president and CEO.  &#8220;Now, companies large and small can combine Geoloqi&#8217;s check-ins, location-based messaging, geofence alerts and real-time maps with Locaid&#8217;s 350 million device footprint and privacy services to create amazing capabilities and apps for any device, anywhere, locatable anytime.  Personally, I&#8217;m also delighted to be working with world&#8217;s foremost cyborg anthropologist.&#8221;</p>

        <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aaronpk/6958109913/in/photostream/"><img src="https://geoloqi.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/portland-gps-logs-aaron-parecki.jpg" alt="Visualization of 2.5 million GPS points for 3.5 years" title="portland-gps-logs-aaron-parecki" width="1483" height="537" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1777" /></a></p>
<h3>About the These Maps</h3>
<p>These are images of map generated entirely from GPS logs gathered by various versions of the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/geoloqi/id415603875?mt=8">Geoloqi sample application</a> for iPhone and Android for the past 3.5 years. Once gathered, the data was run through a custom script that projects the GPS logs onto a 2D image plane. There is a little bit of logic to smooth out the lines and remove some (but not all) GPS noise. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aaronpk/6958109913/sizes/l/in/photostream/"><img src="https://geoloqi.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/aaron-parecki-gps-map-portland-geolocation-app-zoomed-in.jpg" alt="Aaron Parecki&#039;s GPS Map of Everywhere he&#039;s been in Portland since 2008" title="aaron-parecki-gps-map-portland-geolocation-app-zoomed-in" width="1024" height="819" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1765" /></a></p>
<h3>How Many Data Points?</h3>
<p>Approximately one GPS point was recorded every 2-6 seconds when I was moving, and these images represent about 2.5 million total GPS points. Collectively, they represent a data portrait of my life: everywhere I&#8217;ve been and the places I&#8217;ve been most frequently. The map is colored by year, so you can see how my footprint changes over the years, depending on where I live.</p>

<p>The long diagonal lines are airplane flights in and out of PDX. Some of the flights loop over the city when they take off. </p>

<h3>Methods</h3>
<p>To get data at this resolution, I had to bring back-up batteries with me and charge my phone whenever I could. I would manually turn the tracker on when I moved, and turn it off when I was at an indoor location for a long period of time. To get this level of accuracy results in a great deal of battery drain.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why I started Geoloqi is to be able to make tracking this kind of data easier for myself, and to improve battery life (along the way we took some of my manual methods for battery management and bundled it up into a set of mobile SDKs for <a href="https://developers.geoloqi.com/ios">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://developers.geoloqi.com/android">Android<a> for adding location to applications without the intensive battery drain). </p>
<p>Below is an image of the script while it is running to produce the GPS maps. You can see a video of it <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aaronpk/4789077400/in/set-72157623306420643">processing a couple million GPS points here</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aaronpk/4789077400/in/set-72157623306420643"><img src="https://geoloqi.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/generating-the-gps-data-1.jpg" alt="Command Line Prompt for Entering GPS Data" title="generating-the-gps-data-1" width="1581" height="657" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1790" /></a></p>
<h3>Use in Media</h3>
<p>Some of the earlier images of the GPS maps started appearing in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aaronpk/4786064324/">Wired online</a> starting last year.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aaronpk/4786064324/"><img src="https://geoloqi.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/wired-threat-level-gps-tracks-aaron-parecki.jpg" alt="Wired - Threat Level Blog - GPS Tracking" title="wired-threat-level-gps-tracks-aaron-parecki" width="717" height="839" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1775" /></a></p>
<h3>History</h3>
<p>My fascination with GPS and data logging began at a relatively early age (around 10-12 years old, from 4th-6th grade). I recently found my stack of notepads from 3/29/1995 through 6/9/1997 where I logged my commute to school. I have mostly complete logs for the entire date range, including start time, end time, time traveled, who drove, and in what car. In addition, I used to take a highlighter </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aaronpk/4515731598/in/set-72157623306420643/"><img src="https://geoloqi.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/commute-logs-portland-1995-1997.jpg" alt="Analog Commute Logs - 1995-1997" title="commute-logs-portland-1995-1997" width="1024" height="680" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1786" /></a></p>
<h3>Why do This?</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve always found it interesting to take raw data and make it visible. Before GPS chips were available in smartphones, it was very difficult to get high resolution data like this. Ubiquitous provides a way to see over time what was formerly invisible data. It allows one to see over time. In each of these cases, I&#8217;ve been able to process the raw data to answer personal questions like &#8220;what time is best to leave the house in the morning for work?&#8221;. Best of all, it is private data that I own and can do with what I like. </p>
<h3>More Images</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to see all of the images I&#8217;ve recorded over the past 3.5 years, there&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aaronpk/sets/72157623306420643/detail/">GPS Logs set on Flickr here</a>. </p>

&#8220;The holy grail of mobile geo-location services is persistent, aware, real-time data delivered straight to your device&#8230;Portland-based startup Geoloqi thinks it can pull it off.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/mobile/2012/02/the-holy-grail-of-rich-locatio.php">ReadWriteWeb</a></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>Geolocation Heats Up With Geoloqi&#8217;s Battery Saving Tech</strong><br />
&#8220;One of the primary problems with location-tracking apps today is that they have a tendency to drain smartphones’ batteries by always running the GPS in the background, or constantly pinging cell towers. With the Geoloqi SDK, however, Case explains that algorithms know when to turn the GPS on and off. For example, if an app is using geofences, it knows that the GPS doesn’t have to constantly be running unless you’re near those geofences, she says.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/23/geolocations-potential-heats-up-with-geoloqis-battery-saving-tech/">TechCrunch</a></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>Checking in with Geoloqi: Amber Case of Next-Gen Geo-Tracking and Keeping (some stuff) Free</strong> &#8220;As of this morning, Geoloqi has opened the floodgates to new users and customers to build upon their platform in what seems to be any direction imaginable. “If it’s a company looking at a mobile strategy that deals with location,” Case says, “We can handle it.”&#8221; &#8211; <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/meghancasserly/2012/02/23/amber-case-geoloqi-foursquare-location-gps-sxsw/">Forbes</a></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>Geoloqi Helps Location Based Services Take Flight</strong><br />
&#8220;Geoloqi offers a cross platform SDK for iOS and Android that can be ported to Windows and other devices and can work on any carrier network. Developers can enable geofencing, automatic check-ins and location-based messaging, which is one of the most promising opportunities for marketers to target consumers. There’s also rich analytics for tracking users, dwell time, visitors and geofencing.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="http://gigaom.com/mobile/geoloqi-helps-location-based-services-take-flight/">GigaOM</a></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>Cyborg anthropologist’s startup brings people &amp; computers closer together</strong><br />
&#8220;The startup has been the buzz of the Internet for a couple months, but today marks its official launch as well as the availability of its fully agnostic SDK for iOS and Android, as well as its proprietary API.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2012/02/23/geoloqi-launch/">Venturebeat</a></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>Geoloqi Offers Up Tools so Location Apps can Finally Realize Their Potential</strong><br />
“The Geoloqi SDK enables accurate, customizable geofencing, auto check-ins, and automatically manages a device’s battery life while using location, so users can run the app all day without significant battery daring.” And that fact that it plans to offer up this technology for other developers means that a fleet of battery-saving, more immersive location apps could hit in the foreseeable future.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/geoloqi-offers-up-tools-so-location-apps-can-finally-realize-their-potential/">Digital Trends</a></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>Geoloqi Launches Platform for White Label Geolocation Apps</strong><br />
“With Geoloqi, we’re able to track our personnel in real-time, anywhere in the world, on any device, ultimately saving lives in the process,” said David Ayres, of TATE, Inc.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="http://siliconangle.com/blog/2012/02/23/geoloqi-launches-platform-for-white-label-geolocation-apps/">SiliconAngle</a></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>Geoloqi exits beta, reveals geolocation tools for enterprise developers</strong><br />
&#8220;Geolocation has the potential to become an indispensable part of our lives,&#8221; said Amber Case, CEO and founder of Geoloqi, in an interview with FierceMobileContent. &#8220;But in order for geolocation to be a valuable service to end users, the technology needs to be invisible yet opted into, private, and secure.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="http://www.fiercedeveloper.com/story/geoloqi-exits-beta-reveals-geolocation-tools-enterprise-developers/2012-02-23">Fierce Developer</a></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>Real-Time Location Platform Heats up on iPhone, Android</strong><br />
&#8220;We want to bridge the first generation of location services to the next generation of location services. Not just point based. Not just carrier based. Not just one aspect of location services,” said Geoloqi’s Amber Case.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2012/02/23/real-time-location-platform-heats-up-on-iphone-android/">ProgrammableWeb</a></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>Portland&#8217;s Geoloqi Launches its Next-Generation Location Tracking Platform</strong><br />
&#8220;Geoloqi&#8217;s technology runs in the background of smartphones, passively tracking their location. It handles the information instead of working through a third party. That&#8217;s a change from today&#8217;s standard location apps, which require effort on part of the user.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/small-business/index.ssf/2012/02/portlands_geoloqi_launches_its.html ">Oregonian</a></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>Geolocation Takes Off</strong><br />
&#8220;Geoloqi features a language agnostic SDK for iOS and Android, with a complete stack of geolocation tools, including geo-fencing, messaging, security and analytics. Their secret sauce is in the algorithms that conserve battery life, minimizing GPS, WiFi and cellular pings, while delivering 20 ft accuracy with “opt-in” control.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="http://www.dailywireless.org/2012/02/23/geolocation-takes-off/">Daily Wireless</a></p></blockquote>
